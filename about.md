## Algorithm Engineer in Huawei

**Company**: Huawei

**Position**: Contract

**Employment Duration** : 3 yrs

**Location**: Shenzhen, Guangdong, China

**Content**:
I worked in the Health Intelligent Twins & Enterprise Intelligence Department, in Huawei Cloud. Its field of research is to promote the implementation of deep learning in genomics, computer-aided drug design, and medical imaging.

My main activity was to apply Deep Learning techniques for gene variant calling, medical image-assisted diagnosis, and virtual drug screening.

The main project in which I was involved was a Tensorflow-based AutoML Framework named [AutoGenome](https://doi.org/10.1101/842526), which enables the developer to learn the deep learning framework automatically based on the structured gene data. I was responsible of developing, together with a PhD college, the basic framework, algorithmic part of the system:
Architecture design, network search(define ENAS, ResNet, DenseNet, MLP), model interpretability.

The second worth saying project was using a Large-scale computer cluster for computer-aided drug screening to fight against Covid-19. I was responsible to use k8s cluster to manage more than 200 machines to screen the potential molecular from ZINC, DrugBank, Unichem database basing on the docking with Mpro and Spike protein. Pls look at the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00821)

Other projects including building the pipelines of basecalling(guppy), variant calling(gatk4, parabricks, deepvariant), reference assembly(medaka) and quality control using kubenetes system for the gene project, using the computer vision algorithm for lung cancer detection , facial recognition, pedestrian traffic statistics and video synopsis.
