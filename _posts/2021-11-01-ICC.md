## 10 Forms of ICC

## How to select the right form of ICC
(1) Do we have the same set of raters for all subjects? 

(2) Do we have a sample of raters randomly selected from a larger population or a specific sample of raters? 

(3) Are we interested in the reliability of single rater or the mean value of multiple raters? 

(4) Do we concern about consistency or agreement?
### Model Selection
#### One-Way Random-Effects Model
Each subject is rated by a different set of raters who were randomly chosen from a larger population of possible raters. Example: one set of raters may assess a subgroup of subjects in one center and another set of raters may assess a subgroup of subjects in another center, and hence, 1-way random-effects model should be used in this case.

Using this model, the raters are considered the source of random effects. This model is rarely used in practice because the same group of raters is usually used to rate each subject.([refer1](https://www.statology.org/intraclass-correlation-coefficient/))
#### Two-Way Random-Effects Model
If we randomly select our raters from a larger population of raters with similar characteristics, 2-way random-effects model is the model of choice. In other words, we choose 2-way random-effects model if we plan to generalize our reliability results to any raters who possess the same characteristics as the selected raters in the reliability study.

Using this model, both the raters and the subjects are considered sources of random effects.

#### Two-Way Mixed-Effects Model
We should use the 2-way mixed-effects model if the selected raters are the only raters of interest.With this model, the results only represent the reliability of the specific raters involved in the reliability experiment. They cannot be generalized to other raters even if those raters have similar characteristics as the selected raters in the reliability experiment. As a result, 2-way mixed-effects model is less commonly used in interrater reliability analysis.



### “Type” Selection
#### mean of k raters
If we plan to use the mean value of 3 raters as an assessment basis, the experimental design of the reliability study should involve 3 raters, and the “mean of k raters” type should be selected.
#### single rater”
Conversely, if we plan to use the measurement from a single rater as the basis of the actual measurement, “single rater” type should be selected even though the reliability experiment involves 2 or more raters.

### “Definition” Selection
For both 2-way random- and 2-way mixed-effects models, there are 2 ICC definitions: “**absolute agreement**” and “**consistency**.” Selection of the ICC definition depends on whether we consider absolute agreement or consistency between raters to be more important.

**Absolute agreement** concerns if different raters assign the same score to the same subject.

**Consistency** definition concerns if raters’ scores to the same group of subjects are correlated in an additive manner.

Example:
Consider an interrater reliability study of 2 raters as an example. In this case, *consistency* definition concerns the degree to which one rater’s score (y) can be equated to another rater’s score (x) plus a systematic error (c) (ie, y = x + c), whereas *absolute agreement* concerns about the extent to which y equals x.

### Selection flow chart

### Characteristic
>* 1.If the data sets are identical, all ICC estimates will equal to 1.
>* 2.Generally speaking, ICC of the “mean of k raters” type is larger than the corresponding “single rater” type.
>* 3.The “absolute agreement” definition generally gives a smaller ICC estimate than the “consistency” definition.
>* 4.One-way random-effects model generally gives a smaller ICC estimate than the 2-way models.
>* 5.For the same ICC definition (eg absolute agreement), ICC estimates of both the 2-way random- and mixed-effects models are the same because they use the same formula to calculate the ICC


### ICC Interpretation
We have to understand that there are no standard values for acceptable reliability using ICC.

As a rule of thumb, researchers should try to obtain at least 30 heterogeneous samples and involve at least 3 raters whenever possible when conducting a reliability study.

>* <0.5 poor reliability,
>* 0.5~0.75 moderate reliability,
>* 0.75~0.9 good reliability,
>* \>0.9 excellent reliability.

## Examples in R code （”irr“ package）
### two-way random effects model, absolute agreement, single

```R
#load the interrater reliability package
library(irr)

#define data
data <- data.frame(A=c(1, 1, 3, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7),
                   B=c(2, 3, 8, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9, 8, 8),
                   C=c(0, 4, 1, 5, 5, 6, 6, 9, 8, 8),
                   D=c(1, 2, 3, 3, 6, 4, 6, 8, 8, 9))

#calculate ICC
icc(data, model = "twoway", type = "agreement", unit = "single")

   Model: twoway 
   Type : agreement 

   Subjects = 10 
     Raters = 4 
   ICC(A,1) = 0.782

 F-Test, H0: r0 = 0 ; H1: r0 > 0 
    F(9,30) = 15.3 , p = 5.93e-09 

 95%-Confidence Interval for ICC Population Values:
  0.554 < ICC < 0.931
```

## Examples in R code （”psych“ package）
>* ICC1: One-way random-effects model
>* ICC2: Two-way random-effects model
>* ICC3: Two-way mixed effects model
>* ICC1, ICC2 and ICC3 to specify the reliability for a sing rating;
>* ICC1k, ICC2K and ICC3K to design the reliability for the average of k raters
