# Introduction
The **funnel** to the question. From the **known** to the **unknown**. The "known" includes how the question relates to the previous work and why the question is important.


# Materials and Methods
The experiments done to answer the question.
The Materials and Methods section is pure **cookbook**, stating the purpose of each procedure indicates **how** that procedure helps answer the question.

# Results
The results found that answer the question.

# Discussion
>* The beginning states the answer to the question and gives evidence that supports the answer.
>* The middle explains the answer, thus indicating how the answer fits in with previous work.
>* The end restates the answer or states recommendations, applications, implications, or speculations, thus indicating the importance of the answer, or does both.

Topic sentences at the beginning of every paragraph, either alone or in combination with transition words, phrases, or clauses, repeated key terms, and other techniques of continuity, tell the story in the Discussion.

# Important Information to Include

* the question (in the abstract and in the Introduction).

* the answer (in the abstract and in the Discussion).

* the animal or population studied, and the molecule, cell line, tissue, or organ studied

>* in the title.

>* in the abstract.

>* in the question or the experimental approach (Introduction).

>* in Methods.

>* in Results.

>* in the answer or the signal of the answer (Discussion).

>* in at least the first figure legend.

>* in at least the first table title.

* key aspects of the methods and data analysis (in Methods).

* the study design (in Methods for studies in which all experiments are designed in advance; in Results for studies in which the results of one experiment determine what the next experiment will be).

* all relevant results, whether or not they support your answer (in Results), and supporting data (in figures, tables, or the text).

* alternative explanations of results (in the Discussion).

* discussion of any weaknesses in the study design, limitations of the methods, and the validity of assumptions (in Methods or the Discussion).

* definitions of abbreviations.

* definitions of values after a “±” in tables and in the text.

* definitions of error bars in graphs.

* the sample size (n).

* sufficient information in figure legends and in footnotes of tables to make the figure or table understandable without reference to the text.

* important references.

# Make your paper short, meaty, and clear.

## Introduction
>* Start close to the specific topic.
>* Do not review the literature.
>* Funnel as efficiently as possible to the question.

## Methods
>* Omit details of well known methods that have already been reported; cite a reference.

>* For methods that have been reported but are less well known, include a brief description in addition to citing a reference.

## Results
>* Give only the overview.

>* Do not repeat data shown in figures and tables.

>* Omit separate sentences describing figures and tables.

>* For studies in which all experiments are designed in advance, omit separate sentences describing methods.

## figures and tables
>* Omit nonessential figures and tables and nonessential data.
>* Do not present the same data in both a figure and a table.

## Discussion
>* Do not begin by repeating the Introduction or writing a new Introduction. Do not begin with a summary of the results.

>* Do not include tangential topics.

## Reference list
>* Have a sufficient number of references to give credit to others' work and to direct readers to sources of further information.

>* Keep the number of references to a minimum.

## Abstract 
>* Omit all noncrucial details and noncrucial data.

>* Use percent change instead of exact values where possible.

# Tips

## In all sections of the paper
>* Organize from most to least important when useful (usually in the Discussion; where appropriate in Methods and Results).
>* Use topic sentences to state the overview whenever possible.
>* Check that reading the first sentence or two of every paragraph reveals the story.

## Figures and tables
>* When appropriate, show the main story of the paper in figures and background information in tables.
