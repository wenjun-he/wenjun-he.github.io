## What is Cohen’s D?

Cohen’s D or standardized mean difference, is a way to measure effect size.
A P-value can tell you if there is an effect or not, but it won't tell you how large the effect is. That is what Cohen's D do, which measures the effect size of the difference between two means.

## Formula

> sample size > 50

d=( $ M_ {1} $ - $ M_ {2} $ )/ $ s_ {pooled} $ 

*  $ M_ {1}$ = mean of group1
*  $ M_ {2} $= mean of group2
* $ s_ {pooled} $ =  
    * Equal Sample size

       $ \sqrt { \frac{(s_ {1}^ {2}+s_ {2}2)}{2}} $   


    * Unequal Sample size 
       
      $ \sqrt {\frac{((n_{1}-1)\times s_{1}^ {2}+(n_{2}-1)\times s_ {2}2)}{(n_{1} + n_ {2} - 2)}} $

> sample size ≤50


d=$ \frac{(M_ {1}  -  M_ {2}  )}{ s_ {pooled} }   \times  (  \frac {N-3}{N-2.25}  ) \times   \sqrt {\frac {N-2}{N}} $ 

## Interpreting results
d = N ： The two groups differ by N standard deviation(Z-scores)

Rule of thumb interpretation
* <0.2 = "TRIVIAL"
* 0.2 = SMALL EFFECT
* 0.5 = MEDIUM EFFECT
* 0.8 = LARGE EFFECT

## Transforming Cohen's D into other measues

* Hedge's g

Hedges’ g is also a measure of effect size. Hedges’ g and Cohen’s d are extremely similar. The two statistics are very similar except when sample sizes are below 20, when Hedges’ g outperforms Cohen’s d. Hedges’ g is therefore sometimes called the corrected effect size. For very small sample sizes (<20) choose Hedges’ g over Cohen’s d.

g = $ \frac{cohen-d}{\sqrt(\frac{N}{df})} $

where:
* N = samples size,
* df = degrees of freedom
