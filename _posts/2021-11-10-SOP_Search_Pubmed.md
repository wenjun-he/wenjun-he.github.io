# Terms

### Pubmed
**PubMed** is a free search engine accessing primarily the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on **life sciences** and **biomedical topics**. The United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health maintain the database as part of the Entrez system of information retrieval
### MeSH database
**MeSH** (Medical Subject Headings) is the NLM controlled vocabulary thesaurus used for indexing articles for PubMed.

### Biblimetrix
The subject of **bibliometrics**, sometimes referred to as **scientometrics**, has to do with quantitative evaluation of scientific articles and other published works, including the authors of these articles, the journals where the works were published, and the number of times they are later cited.
