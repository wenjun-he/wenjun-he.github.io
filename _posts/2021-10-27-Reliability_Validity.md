# Overview of Reliablity and Validity

Reliability implies consistency: if you take the ACT five times, you should get roughly the same results every time. A test is valid if it measures what it’s supposed to.

Tests that are valid are also reliable.  However, tests that are reliable aren’t always valid.

# What's Reliability
## Internal Reliability

Internal reliability, or internal consistency, is a measure of how well your test is actually measuring what you want it to measure. 

## External reliability
External reliability means that your test or measure can be generalized beyond what you’re using it for.(Example:A test for depression should be able to detect depression in different age groups, for people in different socio-economic statuses, or introverts.)

# What's Validity
## Composite Reliability
